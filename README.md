# YelpSQLAnalysis
Final project in UC Davis's SQL for Data Science certificate course.

### Introduction
In the last week of the SQL for Data Science course offered by UC Davis through Coursera, students are provided a Yelp dataset and then asked to profile and analyze that dataset using SQL, namely the SQLite DBMS. All SQL code and insights provided within this repository constitute original responses to the question prompts.

### Overview
This assignment was broken into 3 parts: profiling the dataset, analyzing the dataset, and then considering additional analysis that could be conducted and the initial next steps one would take to pursue that analysis. 

The dataset provided is an abridged version of Yelp's review database, limited to a total of 10,000 distinct values in each primary key variable.
